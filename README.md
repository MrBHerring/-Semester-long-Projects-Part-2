Study the implemented project on LAPD crime classification which is posted on Githhub here

https://github.com/datadesk/lapd-crime-classification-analysisLinks to an external site.

Note that this code solution uses only the Support Vector Machine (SVM) from Scikit Learn. 

Your tasks are to: 

make sure the code on SVM runs on the most recent version of Scikit Learn. You may need to make some changes/updates to the code. 
implement the classification with K-nearest neighbors and Naive Bayes classification using Scikit Learn
For submission you need to upload the classifications notebook.
